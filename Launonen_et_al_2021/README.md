# TMA-project

R-codes used for the manuscript **"Single-cell tumor-immune microenvironment of BRCA1/2 mutated high grade serous ovarian cancer"**. The required packages to run the codes are presented on the beginning of each .R file. The figures to which the codes correspond to are also denoted in the beginning of each file.

Data for plots can be found at SYNAPSE DOI: 10.7303/syn23747228 upon manuscript publication.

  - TMA_annotated_single_cell_data.csv contains the cell id, core, patient, log-transformed marker expressions, x- and y-positions, and the eccentricity of each cell as well as its cell type annotation.

  - TMA_clinicaldata.csv contains clinical data for the patients including tumor HR-status, PFI time, PFI status, OS time and OS status, as well as immunohistochemical stainings for CD3, CD4 and CD8 antibodies.

  - TMA_mapping.csv contains the TMA cores matched to their patient of origin.



The R-codes were on run Windows 10, R version 3.6.1.
